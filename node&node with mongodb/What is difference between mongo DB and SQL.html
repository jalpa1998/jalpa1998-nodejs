  *MongoDB
MongoDB is what is called a NoSQL database. This means that pre-defined structure for the incoming 
data can be defined and adhered to but also, if required different documents in a collection can 
have different structures. It has a dynamic schema.

MySQL as the name suggests uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for database access. 
The schema can not be changed. The inputs following the given schema are only entered.
