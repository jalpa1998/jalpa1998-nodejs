/*Q3 WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAFGES OF USING PROMISES INSTEND OF CALLBACK?

*advantages of promises of callback*

1).Avoiding "callback hell": Promises encapsulate all logic into one object, which can be reused. 
This helps avoid the "callback pyramid of doom". 

2).Catching errors: Promises catch all errors, including thrown exceptions and programming errors. 
They also have a standardized interface for managing errors. 

3).Easier to read: Promises are easier to read and make it easier to manage multiple asynchronous 
operations.

4).Clean syntax: Promises have a clean and elegant syntax.

5).Chaining: Promises can be chained together to perform complex operations.

6).Async/await: Promises can be used with the async/await code. 

7).Simplifying parallelization: Promises simplify parallelizing many asynchronous operations.

8).More control and trust: Promises offer more control and trust than callbacks. */
