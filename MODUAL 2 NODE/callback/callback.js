/*Q2 Explain callback in Node.js
Node. js callbacks are a special type of function passed as an argument to another function.

They're called when the function that contains the callback as an argument completes its execution,
and allows the code in the callback to run in the meantime.

Callbacks help us make asynchronous calls. Even Node.js APIs are written in a way that supports callbacks*/
